# pizza_simulator

The simulation written in Processing shows what happens when pizza arrives at ITP every Friday. 
This is my final project for the Nature of Code class by Dan Shiffman at ITP. 

Project description is found [here](http://yeseul-itp.tumblr.com/post/158432793452/pizza-itp-implementation).
